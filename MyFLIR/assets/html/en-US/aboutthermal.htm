<title>About thermal imaging</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Thermal imaging is one of the most powerful technologies ever developed to enhance human vision. With the camera, a thermal camera allows us to see things the naked eye could never perceive on its own. But how?</p>
<p>Normally, human vision is limited to a very narrow “visible” band of the electromagnetic spectrum. The wavelengths of the infrared part of spectrum are longer than visible light. They are so long, in fact, that the human eye cannot see them, just like we can’t see microwaves. With thermal imaging, the portion of the spectrum we perceive is dramatically expanded, helping us to detect heat even in the absence of light.</p>
<p>Using special sensor technology, the camera converts heat, which is emitted from all objects, into color images. These color images allow users to not only see in the dark but to also observe differences in temperature of fractions of a degree.</p>
<p>The camera’s powerful capacity to augment human vision opens a new world of possibilities for consumers. In addition to seeing in the dark and detecting invisible heat sources, the device helps users see through smoke.</p>
<p>While thermal imaging opens a whole new world of uses and opportunities to consumers, it is not the same as “X-ray vision.” The camera cannot see through walls, doors, glass, or clothing; detect buried objects; or accurately gauge the surface temperature of shiny materials, which reflect heat from their surroundings.</p>
