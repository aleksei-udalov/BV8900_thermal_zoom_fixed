</head>
<body>
<p>Thank you for choosing the Cat&reg; S62 Pro; with MyFLIR Pro!</p>
<ul>
    <li>With the ability to see what the naked eye can't, MyFLIR Pro, powered by the Lepton 3.5 thermal imaging core, provides a visual image of minute temperature differences, giving users the power to see in the dark, observe invisible heat sources, compare relative temperatures, and see through smoke.</li>
    <li>Created to enhance the camera device experience, MyFLIR Pro provides a simple and intuitive user interface with a variety of improved functions that make it easy to customize, collect, modify, and share useful and compelling thermal images. The MyFLIR Pro app features a toolbox of new features that allow detailed analysis of streaming or captured thermal images.
    <li>Some of these new features include Isotherms (highlighted temperature ranges), Temperature Triggered Alarms, and new Blending mode options for capturing thermal data. This is all paired with VividIR, which improves details significantly compared to the standard MyFLIR thermal image.
