<p>Teledyne FLIR’s powerful thermal imaging has revolutionized modern military operations, law enforcement, search and rescue, and more. Now, consumers can harness that power for a broad range of applications, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Home improvement</b>: Contractors and DIY homeowners can use the thermal camera to observe slight differences in temperature in buildings and structures that may indicate heat loss, and then make adjustments to optimize energy efficiency. The camera can also help to locate ceiling joists, wall studs, and leaking pipes, differentiate between hot and cold pipes, and spot overloaded circuits, making a range of home assessments, improvements, and repairs much easier.</li>
<li><b>Outdoor recreation</b>: For birders and hunters, the camera lets you observe wildlife, day or night, with a low intrusion level. Campers can use it to navigate in the dark, detect when the day’s catch is fully cooked, or make sure a campfire is out.</li>
<li><b>Security and surveillance</b>: With the camera’s ability to see in the dark, you have a powerful new tool to help protect your home and family. If something goes bump in the night, you can simply point the device in the direction of the noise to find out if someone’s there and see what they’re doing.</li>
<li><b>Safety</b>: The camera can help you to cope with emergency conditions, giving a clear picture of the situation even in smoky environments. If there’s a power outage, the device can help you to safely find your way in the dark.</li>
<li><b>Creativity</b>: The camera’s thermal camera lets you see a hidden world of vibrant color and abstract pattern. Creative minds can turn the device’s unique perspective into beautiful works of art or use thermal images for inspiration.</li>
<li><b>Much more</b>: These applications are only the beginning. Consumers are finding new and innovative ways to use thermal imaging, driving the development of apps that extend the power of personal thermal imaging.</li>
